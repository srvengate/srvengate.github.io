  First description 
  A self-driven individual with an objective of lifelong learning! With this (though fancy sounding) line in mind, I set out to explore the world of Science & Technology and I have to say that it only gets stronger every passing day. 
  
  Quite early on in my formal education the curiosity to build and automate stuff kicked in, leading to learning and working on various robotics applications. Mostly focused on aerial applications during my undergraduate studies soon expanded into diverse applications of autonomous vehicles while working as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Autonomous Vehicles Laboratory, at UT Arlington.
  
  Currently I am working as a Controls Engineer in Advance Vehicle Technology group, Ricardo Inc., where I learn and contribute in solving Vehicle Dynamics, Controls, Estimation and Sensor Fusion, Motion Planning problems on various applications ranging from Passenger Cars, Trucks, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles.
  
  I am always open to talk about exciting applications/opportunities in the space of Self-Driving Cars, Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. The only prerequisite is: What can I learn? ðŸ˜Š
